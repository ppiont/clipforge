This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**ClipForge** is a desktop video editor built with Tauri and Svelte. The application features a compact recorder interface for capturing screen, webcam, or both simultaneously, with a full-sized editor window for trimming, arranging, and exporting video clips.

- **Primary Platform**: macOS
- **Secondary Platform**: Windows
- **Tech Stack**: Tauri (Rust) + Svelte + FFmpeg
- **Status**: MVP deadline Tuesday, full submission Wednesday

## Key Features

### Recording Module
- Separate floating recorder window (400x300px, always-on-top)
- Three recording modes:
  - Screen capture (with audio)
  - Webcam recording (with audio)
  - Simultaneous screen + webcam with picture-in-picture overlay
- Duration timer, red dot indicator, record/stop/save controls
- Auto-saves and auto-imports recordings to timeline

### Editing Features
- Two-track timeline for main video + overlay
- Drag clips from media library to timeline
- Trim (drag clip edges), split (at playhead), delete, and arrange clips
- Horizontal timeline with time ruler and playhead
- Zoom in/out, snap to clip edges
- HTML5 video preview (640x360 or 854x480, 16:9 aspect ratio)
- Playback controls: play/pause (spacebar), scrubbing, stop

### Import & Export
- Import via file picker (MP4, MOV, WebM) or drag-and-drop
- FFmpeg-based export to MP4 (H.264 video, AAC audio)
- Export dialog with resolution selection (720p, 1080p, Source)
- Progress bar with cancel button during export
- Multi-clip composition and overlay support

```

## Backend Architecture (Rust/Tauri)

```
src-tauri/src/
├── main.rs (entry point)
├── lib.rs (Tauri commands)
└── commands.rs (command implementations)

Key Tauri Commands:
- import_video(path) → VideoMetadata
- save_recording(blob, filename) → filepath
- export_video(clips, output) → Result
- open_recorder_window(app)
- close_recorder_window(app)
- get_ffmpeg_path() → String
```

### Window Management
Create recorder window via Tauri:
```rust
#[tauri::command]
fn open_recorder_window(app: tauri::AppHandle) {
    tauri::WindowBuilder::new(&app, "recorder",
        tauri::WindowUrl::App("/recorder".into()))
        .title("Record")
        .inner_size(400.0, 300.0)
        .always_on_top(true)
        .resizable(false)
        .build()
        .unwrap();
}
```

## Data Models

```javascript
// Clip in media library
{
  id: string,
  filename: string,
  path: string,
  duration: number,
  resolution: string
}

// Clip on timeline
{
  id: string,
  clipId: string,
  track: number (0 or 1),
  startTime: number,
  trimStart: number,
  trimEnd: number,
  duration: number
}

// Recording state
{
  isRecording: boolean,
  source: 'screen' | 'webcam' | 'both',
  startTime: number,
  stream: MediaStream
}
```

## FFmpeg Integration

### Common Export Commands

**Single clip with trim:**
```bash
ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -ss [trimStart] -t [duration] -c copy output.mp4
```

**Multiple clips (concatenation):**
```bash
ffmpeg -f concat -safe 0 -i filelist.txt -c copy output.mp4
```

**Picture-in-picture overlay (Track 2 over Track 1):**
```bash
ffmpeg -i track1.mp4 -i track2.mp4 -filter_complex \
  "[1:v]scale=320:240[pip];[0:v][pip]overlay=W-w-10:H-h-10" \
  output.mp4
```

### Export Flow
1. Analyze timeline state (clips, tracks, positions)
2. Generate temporary files for trimmed segments
3. Create FFmpeg command for concatenation/overlay
4. Execute via Tauri shell command
5. Monitor progress (parse FFmpeg stderr)
6. Update progress bar in UI
7. Notify user on completion
8. Clean up temporary files

## Recording Implementation

### Screen Recording (JavaScript)
- Use `navigator.mediaDevices.getDisplayMedia()` with `cursor: "always"`
- Set audio with echo cancellation and noise suppression
- MediaRecorder with VP9 codec at 2.5Mbps
- Save as WebM, convert via FFmpeg if needed

### Webcam Recording
- Use `navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia()` with ideal 1280x720
- Include audio track
- Live preview via `srcObject` assignment
- Same MediaRecorder setup as screen

### Combined Screen + Webcam (PiP)
- Get both streams simultaneously
- Use Canvas API to composite:
  - Draw screen to full canvas
  - Draw webcam as 320x240 in bottom-right (with 20px margin)
- Use `canvas.captureStream(30)` for composite video
- Add audio from screen stream
- Record composite stream to file

## Common Development Commands

```bash
# Development
bun run dev                 # Start Tauri dev server with hot reload

# Building
bun run build              # Build frontend assets
bun run tauri build        # Full app build (Rust + frontend)

# Type checking
bun run check              # Check types and lint
bun run check:watch        # Watch mode

# Running Tauri commands
bun run tauri dev          # Run in dev mode (alternative)
```

## Frontend-Backend Communication

Define commands in Rust and invoke from frontend:

```rust
#[tauri::command]
fn my_command(arg: String) -> String {
    format!("Result: {}", arg)
}
```

```svelte
<script>
  import { invoke } from "@tauri-apps/api/core";

  async function handleClick() {
    const result = await invoke("my_command", { arg: "value" });
  }
</script>
```

## Key Implementation Notes

### Timeline State Management
- Use stores to track playhead position, selected clip, clip arrangements
- Timeline clips reference media library clips by ID
- Support undo/redo considerations for future (not MVP)

### Media Handling
- Load video metadata (duration, resolution) on import
- Store actual files on disk, track paths in state
- Handle WebM recordings + MP4 files in same timeline

### Recording Permissions
- Screen recording requires system permissions (getDisplayMedia prompts)
- Webcam requires user media permission
- Gracefully handle permission denials

### Performance Considerations
- Preview player should be responsive at 1080p
- Timeline with 10+ clips should remain snappy
- Canvas rendering for PiP at 30fps
- Export should not block UI (run in background)

## Risk Areas & Fallback Plans

**High-Risk:**
1. FFmpeg multi-clip export - Complex command generation
2. Recording window management - Tauri multi-window coordination
3. PiP compositing - Canvas rendering performance
4. Timeline drag/drop - Complex interaction state

**Fallbacks:**
- If PiP too complex: Skip simultaneous recording, do separate tracks only
- If multi-window fails: Embed recorder in main window
- If drag/drop problematic: Use buttons for clip operations
- If Windows build fails: Submit macOS only
- If export crashes: Simplify to single-track only

## MVP Checklist (Tuesday)
- [ ] App launches (packaged .dmg)
- [ ] Import MP4/MOV file
- [ ] Video appears in media library
- [ ] Click clip loads in preview
- [ ] Add clip to timeline
- [ ] Trim clip by dragging edges
- [ ] Export to MP4
- [ ] Exported video plays correctly

## Testing Priorities

Focus testing on:
1. **Recording**: All three modes work, permissions handled
2. **Editing**: Clips arrange correctly, trim produces correct output
3. **Export**: Multi-clip timeline exports with correct sequence and audio
4. **Performance**: No crashes with 10+ clips, export doesn't hang
5. **Packaging**: .dmg installer launches on fresh macOS

## Configuration Files

- `package.json` - Dependencies and scripts
- `vite.config.js` - Vite + Tauri-specific settings
- `svelte.config.js` - Adapter-static with SPA fallback
- `jsconfig.json` - TypeScript/JavaScript configuration
- `src-tauri/Cargo.toml` - Rust dependencies
- `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` - Tauri window/app configuration

## Tauri-Specific Notes

- SvelteKit uses adapter-static (no Node.js server in Tauri)
- IPC via `invoke()` for Rust ↔ JavaScript communication
- Vite watches exclude `src-tauri` to avoid rebuild loops
- Multi-window management requires AppHandle in commands
- Recording requires web APIs (getDisplayMedia, getUserMedia)
- Canvas rendering requires web context (can't do in Rust)


You are able to use the Svelte MCP server, where you have access to comprehensive Svelte 5 and SvelteKit documentation. Here's how to use the available tools effectively:

## Available MCP Tools:

### 1. list-sections

Use this FIRST to discover all available documentation sections. Returns a structured list with titles, use_cases, and paths.
When asked about Svelte or SvelteKit topics, ALWAYS use this tool at the start of the chat to find relevant sections.

### 2. get-documentation

Retrieves full documentation content for specific sections. Accepts single or multiple sections.
After calling the list-sections tool, you MUST analyze the returned documentation sections (especially the use_cases field) and then use the get-documentation tool to fetch ALL documentation sections that are relevant for the user's task.

### 3. svelte-autofixer

Analyzes Svelte code and returns issues and suggestions.
You MUST use this tool whenever writing Svelte code before sending it to the user. Keep calling it until no issues or suggestions are returned.

### 4. playground-link

Generates a Svelte Playground link with the provided code.
After completing the code, ask the user if they want a playground link. Only call this tool after user confirmation and NEVER if code was written to files in their project.
