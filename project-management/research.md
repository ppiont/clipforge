# Building a Video Editor Timeline for Tauri/Svelte 5

A production-ready video timeline component requires careful technology selection, architectural planning, and performance optimization. This research reveals that **Svelte 5's new runes system combined with Tauri's native capabilities creates an excellent foundation** for building performant desktop video editors, with a mature ecosystem of compatible libraries now available as of October 2024.

## Recommended libraries and tools

The Svelte 5 ecosystem has matured significantly with native runes support. For video timeline construction, a hybrid approach combining specialized libraries delivers the best results.

### Core timeline foundation

**SVAR Svelte Gantt (wx-svelte-gantt)** stands out as the optimal timeline base. Released with native Svelte 5 support in 2024, it provides drag-and-drop task management, handles 10,000+ items efficiently, offers minute-precision timelines, and includes TypeScript support. Install via `npm install wx-svelte-gantt`. The library's architecture adapts naturally to video editing—tasks become clips, dependencies map to linked audio/video, and the timeline visualization provides the horizontal layout video editors require. As an alternative, **svelte-gantt** offers zero dependencies and high performance, though it requires adaptation from Svelte 4 syntax.

### Drag-and-drop implementation

**@thisux/sveltednd** was built specifically for Svelte 5's runes system. The v0.0.20 release provides draggable/droppable actions with built-in state tracking via `$state`, automatic memory management, and full TypeScript support. The API integrates seamlessly with Svelte 5 patterns—simply import `draggable` and `droppable` actions, then handle state via `DragDropState` callbacks. For battle-tested reliability, **svelte-dnd-action** (1,500+ stars) supports Svelte 5 since v0.9.29, offering production-ready features including keyboard/mouse/touch support, automatic scrolling, and accessibility. Note that Svelte 5 prefers `onconsider` and `onfinalize` over the older `on:consider` syntax.

### UI component library

**shadcn-svelte** provides production-ready components with Svelte 5 compatibility (v1.0.10, October 2024). Essential timeline components include **Slider** for scrubbing and zoom controls, **Resizable** for adjustable track heights, **Scroll Area** for timeline panning, **Context Menu** and **Dropdown Menu** for right-click operations, **Button** groups for playback controls, and **Tooltip** for hover information. Initialize with `npx shadcn-svelte@latest init`, then add components individually: `npx shadcn-svelte@latest add slider button resizable`.

### Canvas rendering

For waveform visualization and video thumbnails, **svelte-konva** offers experimental Svelte 5 support. Built on Konva.js, it provides a declarative canvas API with components like Stage, Layer, Rect, and Circle. Installation requires both packages: `npm i svelte-konva konva`. The component-based approach simplifies complex canvas operations. For simpler needs, native `<canvas>` elements with Svelte 5's `$effect` rune handle rendering efficiently—the rune automatically re-renders when reactive state changes, eliminating manual canvas management.

### Gesture and interaction handling

**svelte-gestures** (v5.1.4, July 2024) supports cross-platform gestures essential for timeline interaction. It provides pan for scrubbing, pinch for zooming, and tap/press for clip selection, all working seamlessly across mouse, touch, and stylus inputs. Install via `npm i svelte-gestures` and use actions like `use:pan` with TypeScript-typed event handlers.

### Tauri-specific tools

For video operations, integrate **FFmpeg/FFprobe** through Tauri commands. FFprobe extracts metadata (duration, resolution, framerate, codec) by calling the binary from Rust with `-print_format json`. For thumbnail generation, FFmpeg creates frame captures at specified timestamps. The Tauri file dialog API handles video file selection with filtering by extension, while `convertFileSrc()` converts file paths to Tauri's asset protocol for secure video loading.

## Architecture and component structure

Building a video editor timeline requires clear architectural boundaries between state management, rendering, and interaction layers. Svelte 5's runes enable fine-grained reactivity that maps naturally to timeline requirements.

### Component hierarchy

Structure your timeline using container/presentation separation. The root **TimelineEditor** component manages global state and coordinates child components. Inside, **TimelineContainer** holds the smart component logic with Svelte 5 runes state management. **TimelineHeader** displays controls, zoom level, and playhead time. **TimelineCanvas** renders the main timeline area, containing repeatable **TimelineTrack** components (one per video/audio/overlay track), each housing multiple **TimelineClip** components with drag/resize capabilities. The **Playhead** component displays the current time indicator that overlays all tracks.

This hierarchy separates concerns effectively—containers manage state, presentations handle rendering, and tracks/clips remain reusable across different timeline views. Fine-grained reactivity with runes ensures only changed clips re-render, not entire tracks.

### State management with Svelte 5 runes

Class-based state management provides the best pattern for complex timeline state. Create a `TimelineState` class in a `.svelte.js` file with reactive properties using `$state()`, derived values using getters, and methods for mutations. For example:

```javascript
export class TimelineState {
  playheadPosition = $state(0);
  zoomLevel = $state(1);
  tracks = $state([]);
  
  get pixelsPerSecond() {
    return 100 * this.zoomLevel;
  }
  
  get totalDuration() {
    return Math.max(...this.tracks.flatMap(track => 
      track.clips.map(clip => clip.endTime)
    ), 0);
  }
  
  setPlayheadPosition(time) {
    this.playheadPosition = Math.max(0, Math.min(time, this.totalDuration));
  }
  
  addClipToTrack(trackId, clipData) {
    this.tracks = this.tracks.map(track => {
      if (track.id === trackId) {
        return {
          ...track,
          clips: [...track.clips, { id: crypto.randomUUID(), ...clipData }]
        };
      }
      return track;
    });
  }
}
```

Share this state across components using Svelte's Context API. In the root component, instantiate the state and call `setContext(TIMELINE_KEY, timeline)`. Child components access it via `getContext(TIMELINE_KEY)`. This pattern avoids prop drilling while maintaining reactivity—any component accessing `timeline.playheadPosition` automatically re-renders when it changes.

### Timeline data structures

Model your timeline data to balance flexibility and performance. Each timeline has a duration, framerate/fps, and an array of tracks. Tracks contain an id, name, type ('video'|'audio'|'text'), array of clips, height in pixels, and locked status. Clips define id, startTime, duration, sourceId referencing the media asset, trimStart/trimEnd for source trimming, layer for z-index, and metadata containing name, thumbnail URL, volume, and effects array.

Computed properties leverage Svelte 5's reactivity. Instead of storing `endTime`, use a getter: `get endTime() { return this.startTime + this.duration; }`. For checking clip visibility, add methods like `overlapsRange(start, end)` that return boolean results. These getters recalculate automatically when dependencies change, keeping your data model minimal and consistent.

### Time-based calculations

All timeline operations depend on accurate time-pixel conversions. Store a base `pixelsPerSecond` value (typically 100) and multiply by `zoomLevel` to get the current scale. Convert time to pixels via `time * pixelsPerSecond`, and pixels to time via `pixels / pixelsPerSecond`. For finding time at mouse position, subtract the container's left boundary from clientX to get relative position, then apply the conversion.

Implement snap-to-grid by rounding times to your grid interval: `Math.round(time / gridInterval) * gridInterval`. For magnetic snapping, check distances to nearby clip edges and snap if within a threshold (typically 0.1-0.2 seconds). This creates professional editing behavior where clips naturally align.

Zoom management requires maintaining the element under the cursor. When zooming, calculate which element is under the mouse, apply the zoom transformation, then adjust scroll position so that element remains under the cursor. Without this, zoom operations feel disorienting as the timeline shifts unexpectedly.

### Tauri integration patterns

Structure your Tauri commands to handle video operations efficiently. Create commands for video metadata extraction, thumbnail generation, and file operations. The frontend calls these via `invoke('get_video_metadata', { path: filePath })`, and Rust handles the heavy lifting. Commands should return Result types for proper error handling.

For video playback, use HTML5's `<video>` element but convert file paths with `convertFileSrc()` from Tauri's API. This converts local paths to Tauri's secure asset protocol. Configure your CSP in `tauri.conf.json` to allow `media-src asset: https://asset.localhost`. Use the Tauri file dialog API for opening videos with proper file type filtering, and implement file drop handlers via `appWindow.onFileDropEvent()` for drag-and-drop support.

Critical for Tauri compatibility: disable SSR in SvelteKit by setting `export const ssr = false` in your root layout. Use the static adapter, not the Node adapter. Tauri doesn't support server-based rendering since it runs as a compiled desktop application.

## Code examples and implementation patterns

Practical implementation requires understanding specific patterns for each timeline feature. These examples demonstrate production-ready approaches.

### Video playback synchronization

HTML5 video's `timeupdate` event fires irregularly (15-250ms intervals), making it unsuitable for smooth timeline synchronization. Instead, use `requestAnimationFrame` for continuous sync:

```javascript
class VideoPlayer {
  constructor() {
    this.video = null;
    this.syncFrameId = null;
  }
  
  init(videoElement) {
    this.video = videoElement;
    
    this.video.addEventListener('play', () => {
      isPlaying.set(true);
      this.startSync();
    });
    
    this.video.addEventListener('pause', () => {
      isPlaying.set(false);
      this.stopSync();
    });
  }
  
  startSync() {
    const sync = () => {
      if (this.video && !this.video.paused) {
        playerTime.set(this.video.currentTime);
        this.syncFrameId = requestAnimationFrame(sync);
      }
    };
    sync();
  }
  
  stopSync() {
    if (this.syncFrameId) {
      cancelAnimationFrame(this.syncFrameId);
    }
  }
  
  seekTo(time) {
    if (this.video) {
      this.video.currentTime = time;
    }
  }
}
```

This pattern ensures the timeline scrubber updates at 60fps during playback, creating smooth visual feedback. The `seekTo` method handles timeline clicks—calculate time from click position and call this method to jump the video.

### Clip trimming with handles

Trimming requires detecting which handle (start or end) the user grabs, then constraining movement within valid bounds. Use canvas for smooth handle rendering:

```javascript
function handleMouseDown(event) {
  const mouseX = event.offsetX;
  const distStart = Math.abs(mouseX - startHandlePos);
  const distEnd = Math.abs(mouseX - endHandlePos);
  
  if (distStart < handleWidth * 2) {
    selectedElement = 'START_HANDLE';
  } else if (distEnd < handleWidth * 2) {
    selectedElement = 'END_HANDLE';
  }
}

function updateHandles(mouseX) {
  const duration = durationPositionRatio * (endHandlePos - startHandlePos);
  if (duration < minDuration || duration > maxDuration) return;
  
  if (selectedElement === 'START_HANDLE') {
    startHandlePos = Math.max(0, Math.min(mouseX, endHandlePos));
  } else if (selectedElement === 'END_HANDLE') {
    endHandlePos = Math.max(startHandlePos, Math.min(mouseX, canvasWidth));
  }
  
  requestAnimationFrame(() => drawSlider());
}
```

Visual feedback enhances usability. Draw semi-transparent overlays (rgba(255,255,255,0.8)) on trimmed regions, render handles with shadow effects, and display time values dynamically. Use `requestAnimationFrame` to ensure smooth updates at 60fps without causing jank.

### Splitting clips at playhead

Splitting divides a clip into two new clips at the playhead position, preserving trim offsets:

```javascript
function splitClip(clip, playheadPosition) {
  if (playheadPosition <= clip.start || playheadPosition >= clip.end) {
    return null; // Playhead not within clip
  }
  
  const leftClip = {
    ...clip,
    id: crypto.randomUUID(),
    end: playheadPosition,
    duration: playheadPosition - clip.start,
    trimEnd: clip.trimStart + (playheadPosition - clip.start)
  };
  
  const rightClip = {
    ...clip,
    id: crypto.randomUUID(),
    start: playheadPosition,
    duration: clip.end - playheadPosition,
    trimStart: clip.trimStart + (playheadPosition - clip.start)
  };
  
  return [leftClip, rightClip];
}
```

The critical detail is adjusting `trimStart` and `trimEnd` so each half plays the correct portion of the source video. For keyboard shortcuts, bind Ctrl+\\ or S key to split all tracks at the current playhead position.

### Multi-track timeline rendering

Render tracks vertically with cumulative positioning:

```javascript
function renderTracks(tracks, container) {
  let cumulativeY = 0;
  
  tracks.forEach(track => {
    const trackEl = document.createElement('div');
    trackEl.className = 'track';
    trackEl.style.height = `${track.height}px`;
    trackEl.style.top = `${cumulativeY}px`;
    
    track.clips.forEach(clip => {
      const clipEl = createClipElement(clip);
      clipEl.style.left = `${timeToPixel(clip.start)}px`;
      clipEl.style.width = `${timeToPixel(clip.duration)}px`;
      trackEl.appendChild(clipEl);
    });
    
    container.appendChild(trackEl);
    cumulativeY += track.height;
  });
}
```

Handle overlapping clips using one of three strategies: **prevent overlap** by checking conflicts before placement, **auto-layer** by assigning clips to sub-layers within tracks, or **ripple edit** by shifting subsequent clips when inserting. Each approach serves different editing workflows—non-linear editors typically allow overlap, while simple editors prevent it.

### Drag and drop from source panel

Initialize source clips as draggable, storing clip data in the dataTransfer object:

```javascript
function initializeDraggable(element, clipData) {
  element.draggable = true;
  
  element.addEventListener('dragstart', (e) => {
    e.dataTransfer.effectAllowed = 'copy';
    e.dataTransfer.setData('application/json', JSON.stringify(clipData));
    
    const dragImage = element.cloneNode(true);
    dragImage.style.opacity = '0.5';
    e.dataTransfer.setDragImage(dragImage, 0, 0);
  });
}
```

On the timeline, handle dragover to show preview and drop to add clips:

```javascript
timeline.addEventListener('dragover', (e) => {
  e.preventDefault();
  e.dataTransfer.dropEffect = 'copy';
  const position = calculateDropPosition(e);
  showDropPreview(position);
});

timeline.addEventListener('drop', (e) => {
  e.preventDefault();
  const clipData = JSON.parse(e.dataTransfer.getData('application/json'));
  const position = calculateDropPosition(e);
  addClipToTimeline(clipData, position);
  hideDropPreview();
});
```

Implement snapping by rounding drop times to grid intervals and adding magnetic snap to nearby clip edges within a threshold (typically 0.2 seconds). Visual preview during drag significantly improves user experience—create a semi-transparent placeholder showing where the clip will land.

### Zoom with mouse wheel

Advanced zoom maintains the element under the cursor. When zooming, track which element the mouse is over, apply the zoom transformation, then adjust scroll to keep that element stationary:

```javascript
function zoomTimeline(wheelEvent, zoomFactor) {
  const mousePosition = wheelEvent.clientX;
  const elementUnderMouse = getElementAtPosition(mousePosition);
  const mouseRelativePos = getRelativePosition(elementUnderMouse, mousePosition);
  
  const elementLeft = getLeft(elementUnderMouse);
  const timelineLeft = getLeft(timelineElement);
  const containerLeft = getLeft(containerElement);
  
  // Apply zoom
  const newWidth = currentWidth * zoomFactor;
  timelineElement.style.width = `${newWidth}px`;
  
  // Calculate scroll adjustment
  const moveAfterZoom = getWidth(elementUnderMouse) * mouseRelativePos;
  containerElement.scrollLeft = 
    elementLeft - timelineLeft - mousePosition + containerLeft + moveAfterZoom;
}
```

This mathematical approach prevents the disorienting shift that occurs with naive zoom implementations. For keyboard controls, bind +/- keys to zoom, and \ to fit the entire timeline in the viewport.

### Selection and deletion

Support single-select (click), multi-select (Ctrl/Cmd+click), range-select (Shift+click), and marquee-select (click-drag on empty timeline):

```javascript
const selectedClips = new Set();

function handleClipClick(clip, event) {
  if (event.shiftKey && lastSelectedClip) {
    selectRange(lastSelectedClip, clip);
  } else if (event.ctrlKey || event.metaKey) {
    toggleSelection(clip);
  } else {
    deselectAll();
    selectClip(clip);
  }
  lastSelectedClip = clip;
}

function deleteSelectedClips(ripple = true) {
  const sortedClips = Array.from(selectedClips)
    .sort((a, b) => a.start - b.start);
  
  sortedClips.forEach(clip => {
    const track = findTrackContainingClip(clip.id);
    const index = track.clips.indexOf(clip);
    const duration = clip.end - clip.start;
    
    track.clips.splice(index, 1);
    
    if (ripple) {
      track.clips.forEach(other => {
        if (other.start >= clip.start) {
          other.start -= duration;
          other.end -= duration;
        }
      });
    }
  });
  
  selectedClips.clear();
  reRender();
}
```

Bind Delete/Backspace keys to trigger deletion. Implement Ctrl+A for select all, Ctrl+C/X/V for copy/cut/paste. Visual feedback via CSS—selected clips get a blue border and elevated z-index, hovered clips show a lighter border.

### Video metadata extraction with Tauri

Create a Rust command that calls FFprobe and parses the JSON output:

```rust
use std::process::Command;
use serde::{Deserialize, Serialize};

#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize)]
struct VideoMetadata {
    duration: f64,
    width: u32,
    height: u32,
    fps: f64,
    codec: String,
}

#[tauri::command]
fn extract_video_metadata(path: String) -> Result<VideoMetadata, String> {
    let output = Command::new("ffprobe")
        .args(&[
            "-v", "quiet",
            "-print_format", "json",
            "-show_format",
            "-show_streams",
            &path
        ])
        .output()
        .map_err(|e| e.to_string())?;
    
    let json_str = String::from_utf8(output.stdout)
        .map_err(|e| e.to_string())?;
    
    let probe_data: serde_json::Value = serde_json::from_str(&json_str)
        .map_err(|e| e.to_string())?;
    
    let video_stream = probe_data["streams"]
        .as_array()
        .and_then(|streams| {
            streams.iter().find(|s| s["codec_type"] == "video")
        })
        .ok_or("No video stream found")?;
    
    Ok(VideoMetadata {
        duration: probe_data["format"]["duration"]
            .as_str()
            .and_then(|s| s.parse().ok())
            .unwrap_or(0.0),
        width: video_stream["width"].as_u64().unwrap_or(0) as u32,
        height: video_stream["height"].as_u64().unwrap_or(0) as u32,
        fps: parse_fps(video_stream["r_frame_rate"].as_str().unwrap_or("0/1")),
        codec: video_stream["codec_name"]
            .as_str()
            .unwrap_or("unknown")
            .to_string(),
    })
}

fn parse_fps(fps_str: &str) -> f64 {
    let parts: Vec<&str> = fps_str.split('/').collect();
    if parts.len() == 2 {
        let num: f64 = parts[0].parse().unwrap_or(0.0);
        let den: f64 = parts[1].parse().unwrap_or(1.0);
        num / den
    } else {
        0.0
    }
}
```

Call from Svelte via `const metadata = await invoke('extract_video_metadata', { path: videoPath });`. This pattern keeps heavy processing in Rust while maintaining a simple JavaScript API.

## Performance considerations

Performance determines whether your timeline feels responsive or sluggish. A 60fps target means each frame has only 16.67ms, requiring careful optimization.

### Rendering strategy selection

Choose your rendering technology based on timeline complexity. **DOM rendering** works well for simple timelines with fewer than 50 clips. It offers easy development with built-in event handling, CSS styling, and accessibility. However, performance degrades significantly beyond 100 elements as layout recalculations become expensive. **Canvas rendering** handles 50-1,000 clips smoothly by bypassing DOM overhead. Single canvas element uses less memory than hundreds of DOM nodes, and GPU acceleration provides better frame rates. The tradeoff is higher development complexity—you must manually implement hit testing and event handling. **WebGL rendering** becomes necessary for 1,000+ clips or when applying real-time effects. WebGL provides maximum performance through GPU parallelization but requires significant expertise. Research comparing D3.js performance shows Canvas is 74x faster than SVG in Chrome and 150x faster in Firefox.

The **hybrid approach** delivers the best results for production editors. Use Canvas or WebGL for timeline track rendering where you have many dynamic elements, but use DOM for UI controls like buttons, dropdowns, and the playhead indicator. This combines performance where it matters with ease of development for auxiliary features.

### Virtualization for large timelines

Only render timeline segments currently in the viewport plus a small buffer zone. Track visible time range based on scroll position and zoom level:

```javascript
class VirtualTimeline {
  getVisibleRange() {
    const scrollLeft = this.container.scrollLeft;
    const buffer = 1000; // pixels
    const start = Math.max(0, scrollLeft - buffer);
    const end = scrollLeft + this.viewportWidth + buffer;
    return { start, end };
  }
  
  getVisibleClips() {
    const range = this.getVisibleRange();
    return this.tracks.flatMap(track =>
      track.clips.filter(clip => {
        const clipStart = clip.start * this.pixelsPerSecond;
        const clipEnd = clipStart + clip.duration * this.pixelsPerSecond;
        return clipEnd >= range.start && clipStart <= range.end;
      })
    );
  }
}
```

Render only visible clips, destroying elements outside the viewport. This enables handling timelines with 1,000+ clips without performance degradation. Update the visible range on scroll, throttling the calculation to run at most once per frame via `requestAnimationFrame`.

### Memory management for video assets

Video files consume massive amounts of memory—4K video can exceed several GB. Implement a **proxy workflow** by generating lower-resolution proxy files (typically 720p or 1080p) during import. Edit using proxies for smooth playback, then relink to originals for final render. This reduces memory usage by 50-75% while maintaining editing fluidity.

For thumbnail generation, use a backend approach with FFmpeg to create filmstrips on video import, then cache these in IndexedDB. Generate multiple density levels for different zoom settings. Show a single-frame placeholder immediately using canvas frame extraction while the full filmstrip loads in the background. Production editors like WeVideo use CSS background-image positioning to display portions of a filmstrip sprite, while others like Canva use canvas rendering for more flexibility.

Implement **lazy loading** with Intersection Observer API. Only load thumbnails when tracks become visible:

```javascript
const observer = new IntersectionObserver(
  (entries) => {
    entries.forEach(entry => {
      if (entry.isIntersecting) {
        const clipEl = entry.target;
        loadThumbnail(clipEl.dataset.videoUrl)
          .then(thumbnail => {
            clipEl.style.backgroundImage = `url(${thumbnail})`;
            observer.unobserve(clipEl);
          });
      }
    });
  },
  { rootMargin: '100px' }
);
```

Set cache size limits (2-4GB recommended) and implement LRU eviction to prevent unbounded memory growth. Use `video.preload = 'none'` to avoid preloading until needed.

### Smooth interactions

Use `requestAnimationFrame` for all animations—playhead movement, clip dragging, zoom operations. RAF automatically synchronizes with the browser's refresh rate (typically 60fps) and batches updates efficiently. Never use `setTimeout` or `setInterval` for visual updates as they don't synchronize with display refresh and cause jank.

For drag operations, use GPU-accelerated CSS transforms instead of position properties. `transform: translate3d(${x}px, ${y}px, 0)` triggers GPU compositing while `left: ${x}px` forces expensive layout recalculation. Apply `will-change: transform` to elements you'll drag, signaling the browser to optimize rendering. Throttle drag event handlers to run at most once per frame:

```javascript
let rafId;
function onDragMove(e) {
  if (rafId) return;
  
  rafId = requestAnimationFrame(() => {
    updateDragPosition(e.clientX, e.clientY);
    rafId = null;
  });
}
```

**Debounce** expensive operations like auto-save (typical delay: 1000ms) and search/filter (300ms). **Throttle** scroll handlers (16ms) and resize operations. This distinction matters—debouncing delays execution until activity stops, while throttling guarantees execution at regular intervals during continuous activity.

### Critical video encoding for smooth scrubbing

HTML5 video seeking depends on keyframe density. Videos encoded with default settings have keyframes every 250 frames, causing choppy scrubbing. For smooth timeline scrubbing, re-encode with keyframes every 5-10 frames:

```bash
# MP4 with keyframe every 10 frames
ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vcodec libx264 -x264-params keyint=10:scenecut=0 -acodec copy output.mp4

# WebM for Firefox (needs keyframe every 2 frames)
ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vcodec libvpx-vp9 -g 2 -acodec copy output.webm
```

Browser differences matter—Safari recreates delta frames automatically providing good scrubbing even with sparse keyframes, while Firefox requires very high keyframe density with WebM format. Provide both formats when possible.

### Performance monitoring

Use Chrome DevTools Performance panel to identify bottlenecks. Yellow bars indicate JavaScript execution, purple shows layout/style recalculation, green represents painting. Tasks exceeding 50ms cause dropped frames. Use the Performance Timeline API to measure critical operations:

```javascript
performance.mark('timeline-render-start');
renderTimeline();
performance.mark('timeline-render-end');
performance.measure('timeline-render', 'timeline-render-start', 'timeline-render-end');
```

Monitor long tasks with PerformanceObserver to detect operations blocking the main thread. Break long-running operations into smaller chunks or move them to Web Workers. Minimize JavaScript bundle size as parse/compile time directly impacts startup performance.

## Best practices for video editor timelines

Professional video timeline implementation requires attention to interaction patterns, state management, and error handling that users expect from mature applications.

### Reactivity patterns with Svelte 5

Use `$state` for values that change over time (playhead position, zoom level, selected clips). Use `$derived` for computed values—never use `$effect` for pure calculations as this causes unnecessary updates. Derived values automatically memoize and only recalculate when dependencies change. Reserve `$effect` exclusively for side effects like DOM manipulation, logging, canvas rendering, or synchronizing with external libraries. Always return cleanup functions from effects to prevent memory leaks.

Avoid circular dependencies in derived values. Structure your state so data flows unidirectionally. For performance-critical paths, use `$state.raw` to bypass proxy creation for large arrays or deeply nested objects that don't need fine-grained reactivity.

### Undo/redo implementation

Build undo/redo from the start as retrofitting proves difficult. Implement a simple history manager:

```javascript
class UndoManager {
  constructor(maxHistory = 50) {
    this.undoStack = [];
    this.redoStack = [];
    this.maxHistory = maxHistory;
  }
  
  saveState(state) {
    this.undoStack.push(JSON.stringify(state));
    if (this.undoStack.length > this.maxHistory) {
      this.undoStack.shift();
    }
    this.redoStack = [];
  }
  
  undo(currentState) {
    if (this.undoStack.length === 0) return null;
    this.redoStack.push(JSON.stringify(currentState));
    return JSON.parse(this.undoStack.pop());
  }
  
  redo(currentState) {
    if (this.redoStack.length === 0) return null;
    this.undoStack.push(JSON.stringify(currentState));
    return JSON.parse(this.redoStack.pop());
  }
}
```

Call `saveState` before operations that modify timeline structure (add/delete/move clips). Bind Ctrl+Z for undo and Ctrl+Shift+Z for redo. Consider command pattern for more complex scenarios where operations need custom undo logic.

### Keyboard shortcuts

Power users expect comprehensive keyboard support. Essential bindings include Space for play/pause, Left/Right arrows for frame-by-frame navigation, J/K/L for reverse/pause/forward (professional editing standard), +/- for zoom, Ctrl+Z/Shift+Z for undo/redo, Delete/Backspace for clip deletion, Ctrl+C/X/V for copy/cut/paste, Ctrl+A for select all, and Ctrl+\\ or S for split at playhead.

Implement shortcuts at the document level but check for input focus to avoid interfering with text entry in forms.

### Accessibility considerations

Timeline editors present unique accessibility challenges. Provide keyboard-only navigation through clips using Tab and arrow keys. Support screen readers by adding ARIA labels to timeline regions, tracks, and clips. Ensure sufficient color contrast for clip boundaries and selection indicators (WCAG AA requires 4.5:1 for text, 3:1 for UI components). Offer text alternatives for visual-only features like waveforms. Allow users to customize zoom and track heights for vision accommodation.

### Cross-browser testing

Test thoroughly across platforms as Tauri uses different WebViews—WebKit on macOS, Chromium (Edge WebView2) on Windows, and WebKitGTK on Linux. Video codec support varies—MP4 with H.264/AAC offers the best compatibility, while WebM works better on Linux. Audio sync behavior differs subtly across platforms. Use feature detection rather than browser detection when handling API differences.

### Error handling and graceful degradation

Video operations fail unpredictably—files may be corrupted, unsupported formats attempted, or memory exhausted. Wrap Tauri invocations in try-catch blocks and provide user-friendly error messages. Show toast notifications for recoverable errors, modal dialogs for critical failures requiring user action. Implement auto-save to prevent data loss during crashes. Log errors to a file via Tauri's logging system for debugging production issues.

When optional features fail (like hardware acceleration or certain codecs), degrade gracefully. Detect feature availability and adjust UI accordingly—disable trim handles for formats that don't support seeking, or fall back to software decoding when hardware fails.

### Project organization

Structure your codebase for maintainability. Create a `timeline/` directory with Timeline, Track, Clip, Playhead, and Trimmer components. Place shared utilities in `utils/` including TimeConverter for time-pixel conversions, UndoManager for history, and helper functions. Isolate interaction logic in `interactions/` with separate modules for DragDrop, Selection, and Zoom. Keep video-specific code in `video/` with VideoPlayer and FrameExtractor modules. This separation enables testing components independently and reusing logic across features.

Version control your timeline data structure carefully. When evolving the format, maintain backwards compatibility or provide migration logic. Consider using a schema version number in saved projects.


### Real-world reference implementations

Study production video editors for architectural insights. **Remotion** demonstrates declarative video composition with React—each clip is a component with timing props, making timeline logic explicit. **Etro.js** shows how to build layer-based composition with WebGL effects and keyframe animation. Both use TypeScript extensively for type safety around timeline data structures. Commercial solutions like IMG.LY CE.SDK reveal the hybrid rendering approach (WebGL for effects, Canvas for simpler operations, DOM for UI) that professional implementations adopt.

Open-source examples provide starting points—browse repositories for concrete implementations of features like trimming, splitting, and multi-track rendering. Adapt patterns to Svelte 5 by replacing React hooks with runes and class components with Svelte component syntax.

### Progressive enhancement approach

Build features incrementally. Start with a basic timeline showing clips on a single track with simple click-to-seek playback. Add drag-to-arrange clips with snapping. Implement zoom controls. Build trimming with draggable handles. Add track management for multi-track. Implement splitting and deletion. Add advanced features like effects, transitions, and audio mixing. This incremental approach allows testing each layer thoroughly before adding complexity.

For your specific Tauri/Svelte 5 setup, the mature ecosystem now available makes building a production-quality timeline feasible. The combination of SVAR Svelte Gantt for timeline foundation, @thisux/sveltednd for drag-and-drop, shadcn-svelte for UI, and Tauri's native capabilities provides a solid technical base. Focus on getting core interactions smooth first—playhead synchronization, drag performance, and zoom behavior determine whether the timeline feels professional. Performance optimization through virtualization and proper rendering strategy selection enables scaling to complex projects. With careful attention to the patterns outlined here, you can build a responsive, feature-rich video editor timeline that delivers the desktop performance users expect from Tauri while leveraging Svelte 5's reactive paradigm.

The research reveals this stack is production-ready as of October 2024, with all major dependencies supporting Svelte 5 and active maintenance continuing. Start with the recommended libraries, implement the architectural patterns described, optimize based on the performance guidelines, and iterate based on user feedback. Building a video editor timeline is complex, but the combination of Tauri's native capabilities with Svelte 5's fine-grained reactivity creates an excellent foundation for success.
